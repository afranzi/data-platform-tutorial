# Building a Data Platform Hands-on Tutorial

## Prerequisites

Please refer to `00_Initialization_script.md` for a list of prerequisites and tools that need to be available during
this tutorial.

## Scripts

Several markdown scripts have been created with the intention of being useful to both instructor and students.

When used in conjunction with the final versions of the code (files matching `*Final.*`) a student should be able to
follow along independently.

They are (in order):

0. 00_Initialization_script.md
1. 01_Kafka_script.md
2. 02_Twitter_Ingest_script.md
3. 03_Transformations_script.md
4. 04_APIs_script.md
5. 05_Notebooks_script.md
